			<h2>Dance</h2>
			<p class="danceInfo">Dancing has always been something that interested me. I was always trying to imitate what I saw in movies and on television. One day I decided to take initative and learn to dance on my own. I went to YouTube and started watching different videos on different techniques. Currently, I perfer footwork over everything else (especially shuffling) and I just recently bought some great shoes for this hobbie (seen below).</p>

			<h2>Guitar</h2>
			<p class="guitarInfo">I started playing the guitar when I was 17. I always had a passion for music, but I was unable to find the an instrument that felt natural to play. The guitar was a common sight to see, and I loved the way it sounded. Eventually, I ended up buying an acoustic guitar. I learned from different online sources and I now know how to read tabs.</p>

			<h2>Concerts</h2>
			<p class="concertsInfo">Starting last summer, I have been extremely interested in seeing live perforamnces. So far I have seen Nicki Minaj and The Weekend for their album tours. I also went to Music Midtown last year to see multiple artist perform, such as Drake, Lenny Kravitz, Sam Smith, and Hozier. I was able to go to these event with some amazing people and it created some of the best memories of my life.</p>
